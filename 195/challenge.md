# Bite 195. Analyze NBA Data with sqlite3

In this Bite you are going to use sqlite3! We loaded some NBA data into a players DB table: a view of the data

Complete the 4 functions after the you code comment, following thier docstrings. You need to use different SQL queries to get the results.

Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
