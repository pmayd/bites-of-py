def high_low_record_breakers_for_2015():
    """Extract the high and low record breaking temperatures for 2015

    The expected value will be a tuple with the highest and lowest record
    breaking temperatures for 2015 as compared to the temperature data
    provided.

    NOTE:
    The date values should not have any timestamps, should be a
    datetime.date() object. The temperatures in the dataset are in tenths
    of degrees Celsius, so you must divide them by 10

    Possible way to tackle this challenge:

    1. Create a DataFrame from the DATA_FILE dataset.

    2. Manipulate the data to extract the following:
       * Extract highest temperatures for each day / station pair between 2005-2015
       * Extract lowest temperatures for each  day / station  between 2005-2015
       * Remove February 29th from the dataset to work with only 365 days

    3. Separate data into two separate DataFrames:
       * high/low temperatures between 2005-2014
       * high/low temperatures for 2015

    4. Iterate over the 2005-2014 data and compare to the 2015 data:
       * For any temperature that is higher/lower in 2015 extract ID,
         Date, Value
         
    5. From the record breakers in 2015, extract the high/low of all the
       temperatures
       * Return those as STATION namedtuples, (high_2015, low_2015)
